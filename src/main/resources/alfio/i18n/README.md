## Help us translate Alf.io into your language!

### How it works

We use POEditor for translating this project in additional languages (including yours!). 
POEditor is so kind to offer us an unlimited open source subscription.

**please be advised that we won't accept Pull Requests for translations.** We consider POEditor as our main channel for this kind of modifications.

Here's how you can become a contributor:

#### 1. Tell us about yourself and explain how you can contribute to the project

Get in touch with us using our [message board](https://github.com/alfio-event/alf.io/discussions?discussions_q=category%3Atranslations). Tell us how you want to help us, and the languages you're interested in.

This is **mandatory**, as we won't accept "random" requests on POEditor

#### 2. Request access to the POEditor project

In order to start contributing, please sign up using [this link](https://poeditor.com/join/project/ttBYTmPYdr) and request to join a translation team. 

If you don't see your language among the list, please drop us a message using the dedicated [message board](https://github.com/alfio-event/alf.io/discussions?discussions_q=category%3Atranslations).

You can request access on POEditor **to any languages except the following**:

- English (main language)
- Italian (the core team's mother tongue)

You can suggest modifications to the translations of certain terms for these language in the [message board](https://github.com/alfio-event/alf.io/discussions?discussions_q=category%3Atranslations)

#### 3. Add yourself to the contributors' list

After your modification is complete, please provide a Pull Request for adding your name/details under the "contributors" section of the [Project Repo page](https://github.com/alfio-event/alf.io/blob/master/README.md).

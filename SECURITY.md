# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest major release, which is at the moment **2.0-M4**.
In case of direct or transitive vulnerability in that code, we'll release a new version as soon as possible. 
Please follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alfio_event) for release announcements, and keep your alf.io updated!

| Version | Supported          |

## Note about the master branch

We consider the "master" branch to be always a "Work in Progress", and as such it might contain vulnerabilities.
Before each release we'll run an additional scan on [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=alfio-event_alf.io) and fix all the security-releated findings.
That branch should not be deployed in production. If you do that, you're on your own.


## Reporting a Vulnerability
